Ahoy! I'm Rita and I am a freelance WordPress developer working their way to becoming a software developer!

I'm a former academic and volunteer who wants to transfer their love of sharing knowledge and helping others into the tech world. I really enjoy making beautiful apps and websites and I have a fascination with cybersecurity and just how much can be learned from all of us just by what we each post online. A bit frightening, really...

When I'm not coding, I'm gaming (badly), cooking (wonderfully) or singing (loudly).
