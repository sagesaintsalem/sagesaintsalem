Ahoy! I'm Rita and I am a WordPress developer working their way to becoming a web developer!

I'm a former academic and volunteer who wants to transfer their love of sharing knowledge and helping others into the tech world. I really enjoy making beautiful apps and websites, I'm always upskilling and I always look for ways in which I can improve myself and my code.

When I'm not coding, I'm gaming (badly), cooking (wonderfully) or singing (loudly).
